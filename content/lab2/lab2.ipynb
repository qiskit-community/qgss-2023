    "Bob's qubit now has the information $|\\psi\\rangle$ from Alice's qubit $q$ encoded in $Bell_1$, but he does not know what basis to measure in to extract it. Accordingly, Alice must share the information in her register over a *classical* communication channel (this is why teleportation does not violate special relativity, no matter how far Alice and Bob are apart). She instructs Bob to perform an X gate on his qubit if her measurement of $Bell_0$ yields a 1 outcome, followed by a Z gate if her measurement of $q$ yields a 1.\n",
